# Reasoning Ability and Hallucination: A Proportional Relationship

## Core Thesis

Reasoning ability and hallucination are proportionally linked. When AI commits to premises and pushes inference forward, "plausible completion" inevitably occurs in areas with insufficient data.

You can reduce hallucinations, but at the cost of reasoning freedom and output volume.

## Why Logical Reasoning ≠ Reality

Logical reasoning doesn't guarantee alignment with reality. Reasoning navigates the world of possibility — reality contains chance and unobserved variables.

"Logically perfect = correct in reality" is an illusion.

Reasoning accuracy and real-world correspondence are separate axes. Hallucination is simply an inevitable byproduct.
